# CareerFoundry-Portfolio
A Portfolio of various projects in learning web development

This is my first attempt at creating a website in many years. I took an interest in web design and development using Geocities and HTMLGoodies back when I was in high school. My brother and I would take turns staying up until morning working on our sites trying to best the other and was a lot of fun. I want to attempt here a more professional site to see if this is a field I'd wish to pivot my career to.
